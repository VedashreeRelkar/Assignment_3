# Assignment_3
For task 1, variable is assigned to take input from user for a number and it is tagged as integer. Then factorial function is defined using if-else. For 0,1 the factorial is 1. Hence for n<2, it is coded to be 1. For numbers greater than 2, formula is used as n*(factorial(n-1)). 
For task 2, variable a is assigned to take input from user and it is tagged as integer. Then various functions are imported from math module - sqrt, log, sin. Lastly, line of code is added to print the square root, logarithm and sine of the entered number on seperate lines.
